# Part 3
1) The main bug with this code was that the sum function was treating the input variables as strings instead of integers meaning that when the function would run its addition operation, it would concatenate the string rather than summing up the values of the numbers themselves.

2) One way to go about fixing this problem would be to simply type cast the numbers passed into the summation function into numbers. In this way, after type casting the variables, the function would view them as numbers rather than strings and would properly add them instead of concatenating the strings as it did before.
